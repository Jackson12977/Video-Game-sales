# Video-Game-sales
This is analysis on video game sales


Some questions answered by this analysis
i. Best selling publisher.
ii. Best selling game.
iii. Best selling genre.
iv. Total generated funds by region and global sales.
v. How video games have been doing since it start in 1980 and which publisher has the largest share.
vi. Monitored how each game has been doing since its release.



My major problem with this dataset is that it started from 1980 and ended 2017
